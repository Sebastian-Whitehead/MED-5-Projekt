# Persistent Guardian Testing Eviroment
***
### Description:
This repository was created in conjunction with the 5. semester, semester project and created to test the premis of a visually persistent virtual reality guaridan system, agaisnt a control (*Meta's quest 2 stock guardian*) in a 3x3meter play-space. In this enviorment the program is capable of recording second to second user position and speed(*m/s*) as quantitative data for user movement behavior during guardian comparison.
***
### Installation:
The unity enviroment within this repository consist of 3 scenes 2 created to be a representative VR enviroment (*have 1, have 2*). The last being a control scene to premote all users starting in a similar orientation and position (*startup scene*). The VR enviroment itself uses the [unity XR interaction toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.2/manual/index.html) to create basic VR compatibility. 

Download whatever software is required to connect and run the respective headset from a vr capable windows computer. Once connection with the headset is established running the unity enviroment should automatically place the into the selected scene.

***
### Usage:
When starting the unity program the user should first be loaded into the startup scene where they are asked to place once hand into each of the red spheres (*These should turn green when a hand is present*). With a hand in each the user must then look at the center of the target infront of them. (*Should also turn green*) While the user achieves this 3 point position the test conductor must press the '1' or '2' nuber keys on the computer in order to determine which enviroment is switched too when the correct position is reached by the user.
*It is recomened to disable the default guardian when using the provided static guardian as otherwise both guardians will be visible, and overlap*

When in the two subsequent testing enviroments the users head position is logged every second while they from which a speed value is calculated. The user can then procede around the enviroment and collect a series of eggs which vanish after a seconds delay. Once stopped this logged data can be found in a csv file under the CSV folder. Each play session marked by a 'new participant' in this csv file.

> âœŽ **Note**:
> The collection of these eggs is purely an encouragement for user movement and not a measured parameter. 

##### Shader Settings:
The packaged guardians shader material has a series of settings which allow adjustment of its' visual appearance. These include the following:

###### Major & Minor sections:
- **Lower Lerp:** Bottom Point for either of the two overlapping gradients  
- **Upper Lerp:** Top Height for either of the two overlapping gradients
- **Trans:** Transparency for the given gradient

###### Overall:
- **OSS trans:** Visibility level of both gradients when obscured by any given virtual object
